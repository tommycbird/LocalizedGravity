Localized Planetary Gravitational Fields with Geometric Deformations

* This idea stems from the gravitational fields created for the game “Super Mario Galaxy” wherein Mario abides by the gravity of whatever planet he’s standing on. In this game, gravitational fields are hardcoded. This project entails building a model that takes a planet (effectively any 3D object) and creating a gravitational field for it.
Planets will be a sample of created test objects in the project. Randomly generated planets will be made for further testing.
* The demo involves a “player” character, which can simply traverse the planets to showcase that the gravity is working properly.
* The technical challenge of this project stems from the issue of deformed planets. For a given sphere, it is easy to make a player character adhere to the gravity based on the centerpoint of that sphere. For a non-sphere planet (i.e. a torus or a C-shaped planet) it is not that simple.
